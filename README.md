## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions from a dataset. Fraudulent transactions are a significant concern for financial institutions, and machine learning provides an effective tool to address this problem.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains transaction records, each with several features that describe the transaction. The dataset includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Due to confidentiality, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can find similar datasets on platforms like Kaggle.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in building a machine learning model. The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Data Cleaning:** Removing or imputing missing values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features based on existing ones.
- **Normalization:** Scaling numerical features to a standard range.
- **Encoding:** Converting categorical features into numerical values.

## Algorithms

Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated for fraud detection, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

## Evaluation

The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
- **F1 Score:** The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
- **ROC-AUC:** The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.

## Results

The Random Forest algorithm provided the best performance with the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 98.5%
- **Precision:** 97.3%
- **Recall:** 96.8%
- **F1 Score:** 97.0%
- **ROC-AUC:** 99.2%

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model was the most effective in detecting fraudulent transactions. However, the performance can be further improved by exploring more advanced techniques and feature engineering.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further tuning of model parameters to improve performance.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining multiple models to achieve better results.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most important features for the model.
